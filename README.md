## FAQ

### 1. *The script doesn't output a response, what do I do?*
**In that case, just retake your images because maybe they aren't clear enough for the script to recognize the text in the images perfectly.**

### 2. *Is 1+1 actually 1.5?*
***yes***

### 3. *Can't you just make a video tutorial? This is too hard for me :/*
**Sure, it will be in the works. (i dont got much time on this project im too busy).**

### 4. *OH NO THE SCRIPT IS REBELLING AGAINST ME WHAT DO I DO?!?!!?!*
**Try running the script again or retake your images. That should be fixed with update V2 or higher though.**

### 5. *bro your stupid ass script got a question wrong (finally), why????*
**It doesn't happen that much, but this is an AI that's responding, so it isn't perfect (no one is perfect anyways).**

### 6. *The script sends an error when I try to use anything other than GPT-4.*
**Try switching to a different network.**
