## FAQ

### 1. *The script doesn't output a response, what do I do?*
 In that case, just retake your images because maybe they aren't clear enough for the script to recognize the text in the images perfectly.

### 2. *Is 1+1 actually 1.5?*
yes

### 3. *Can't you just make a video tutorial? This is too hard for me*
Sure, it will be in the works. (i dont got much time on this project im too busy).

### 4. *OH NO THE SCRIPT IS REBELLING AGAINST ME WHAT DO I DO?!?!!?!*
Try running the script again or retake your images.

### 5. *bro your stupid ass script got a question wrong (finally), why????*
It doesn't happen that much, but this is an AI that's responding (specifically GPT-4), so it isn't perfect (no one is perfect anyways).
