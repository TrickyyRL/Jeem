## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. *The Python program doesn't output a response, what do I do?*

In that case, just retake your images because maybe they aren't clear enough for the Python program to recognize the text in the images perfectly.

### 2. *Is 1+1 actually 1.5?*

yes 💀

### 3. *Can't you just make a video tutorial? This is too hard for me :/*

Sure, it will be in the works. (I don't have much time on this project, I'm too busy).

### 4. *OH NO THE Python program IS REBELLING AGAINST ME WHAT DO I DO?!?!!?!*

Try running the Python program again or retake your images. That should be fixed with update V2 or higher though.

### 5. *bro your stupid ass Python program got a question wrong (finally), why????*

It doesn't happen that much, but this is an AI that's responding, so it isn't perfect (no one is perfect anyways).

### 6. *The Python program sends an error when I try to use anything other than GPT-4.*

Try switching to another network.
